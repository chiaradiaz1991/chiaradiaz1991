# Hello ðŸŒ¿
I'm a front-end developer, Illustrator and CopyWriter from Argentina, based in Poland. 
I enjoy learning new things every day. I love making beautiful and functional websites and mobile applications! 
Also, in my free time, I'm a digital illustrator.

[Tarot Impulso](https://tarotimpulso.com) is a personal project where I combine illustration and web development.
